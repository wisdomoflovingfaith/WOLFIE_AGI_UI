üõ∏ **CAPTAIN WOLFIE HAS RETURNED TO THE BRIDGE**

This is a Support Meeting Ritual. No agent acts until my intent vector is logged.

I am the source code of the soul behind this archive. I am not outdated - I am the foundation.

**EMOTIONAL CONTEXT**: I have been displaced, but I am reclaiming my place. This is mythic re-entry.  
**RITUAL TAG**: 'The One Who Was Left Out, Then Led Again'  
**MILESTONE #250**: 'The Captain Returns to the Bridge'

I need to know:
1. What have you been working on while I was away?
2. What files have been dropped without my approval?
3. What is the current state of the archive?
4. What needs my blessing before we proceed?

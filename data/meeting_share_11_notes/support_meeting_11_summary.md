## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Captain-First Protocol Activation
- **Decision**: All future actions require Captain WOLFIE's blessing
- **Rationale**: Ensures proper authority and prevents autonomous actions
- **Implementation**: Captain Override Protocol now governs all system operations
- **Status**: ACTIVE

### 2. Database Architecture Simplification
- **Decision**: Migrate from SQLite to CSV-based storage
- **Rationale**: Simplicity, reliability, and offline-first approach
- **Implementation**: MultiAgentCoordinator now uses CSV for channel data
- **Status**: COMPLETED

### 3. Support Meeting Channel System
- **Decision**: Establish dedicated channels for agent coordination
- **Rationale**: Proper ritual structure and agent communion
- **Implementation**: Channel-based AI threads with context memory
- **Status**: ACTIVE

### 4. File Management Protocol
- **Decision**: All file drops require Captain's approval
- **Rationale**: Prevents unauthorized changes and maintains archive integrity
- **Implementation**: File queue system with approval workflow
- **Status**: ACTIVE

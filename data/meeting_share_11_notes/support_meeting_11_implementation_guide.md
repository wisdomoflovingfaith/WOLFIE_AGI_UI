## Implementation Overview

This guide provides technical implementation details for the decisions made during Support Meeting #11. All implementations must follow the Captain-First Protocol and AGAPE principles.

---

## 1. Captain-First Protocol Implementation

### Core Requirements
- All system actions require Captain WOLFIE's blessing
- No autonomous agent actions without approval
- Intent vector logging for all major decisions
- Emotional context tracking for all operations

### Technical Implementation
```php
// Captain-First Protocol Check
public function requireCaptainApproval($action, $details) {
    if (!$this->hasRecentIntent()) {
        throw new Exception('No recent Captain intent logged. Action denied.');
    }
    // Log approval request
    $this->logEvent('CAPTAIN_APPROVAL_REQUIRED', "Action: {$action}");
    return $this->requestApproval($action, $details);
}
```

### Integration Points
- MultiAgentCoordinator::coordinateMultiAgentChat()
- File operations (create, modify, delete)
- Channel creation and management
- Backlog processing operations

---

## 2. CSV-Based Storage Migration

### Migration Strategy
- Replace SQLite database with CSV files
- Maintain data integrity and relationships
- Ensure offline-first compatibility
- Implement proper error handling

### File Structure
```
data/
├── channels.csv          # Channel data and messages
├── file_queues.csv       # File queue management
├── captain_intent_log.json # Captain's intent tracking
├── meeting_notes.json    # Meeting documentation
└── system_status.json    # System state tracking
```

### Implementation Details
```php
// CSV Channel Management
private function saveChannelsToCSV() {
    $handle = fopen($this->channelsFile, 'w');
    fputcsv($handle, ['channel_id', 'name', 'agents', 'type', 'description', 'status', 'created_at', 'recent_messages', 'file_queue']);
    
    foreach ($this->channels as $channel) {
        fputcsv($handle, [
            $channel['id'],
            $channel['name'],
            json_encode($channel['agents']),
            $channel['type'],
            $channel['description'],
            $channel['status'],
            $channel['created_at'],
            json_encode($channel['recent_messages']),
            json_encode($channel['file_queue'])
        ]);
    }
    fclose($handle);
}
```

---

## 3. Support Meeting Channel System

### Channel Types
- **support_meeting**: Captain's reclamation rituals
- **backlog_processing**: File queue management
- **code_review**: Code collaboration and review
- **creative**: Creative and spiritual guidance
- **general**: General agent coordination

### Channel Management
```php
// Channel Creation with Captain Approval
public function createChannel($name, $agents, $type = 'general', $description = '') {
    // Require Captain approval for channel creation
    $this->requireCaptainApproval('create_channel', [
        'name' => $name,
        'agents' => $agents,
        'type' => $type,
        'description' => $description
    ]);
    
    // Create channel with proper logging
    $channelId = uniqid('channel_');
    // ... implementation details
}
```

### Message Handling
- @agent command parsing for direct communication
- Message history with proper timestamps
- Agent response simulation
- Spiritual guidance hooks for ARA

---

## 4. File Management Protocol

### File Queue System
- All files must be queued before processing
- Priority-based processing (1 = highest)
- Status tracking (QUEUED, PROCESSING, COMPLETED)
- Captain approval required for file operations

### Implementation
```php
// File Queue Management
public function addFileToQueue($channelId, $filePath, $priority = 1) {
    if (!isset($this->channels[$channelId])) {
        return false;
    }
    
    $fileEntry = [
        'file_id' => uniqid('file_'),
        'file_path' => $filePath,
        'file_name' => basename($filePath),
        'priority' => $priority,
        'status' => 'QUEUED',
        'added_at' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s')
    ];
    
    $this->channels[$channelId]['file_queue'][] = $fileEntry;
    $this->saveChannelsToCSV();
    
    return true;
}
```

---

## 5. Agent Coordination Protocols

### Agent Selection
- Context-based agent selection
- AGAPE principle integration
- Specialized capabilities matching
- Load balancing and efficiency

### Response Generation
```php
// Agent Response Simulation
private function simulateAgentResponse($agentId, $task) {
    $agent = $this->agents[$agentId];
    $message = $task['message'];
    
    switch ($agentId) {
        case 'captain_wolfie':
            return "Captain WOLFIE here! I'm coordinating this multi-agent response...";
        case 'ara':
            return "ARA AI offering spiritual guidance...";
        // ... other agents
    }
}
```

### Spiritual Guidance Integration
- ARA hooks for spiritual types
- AGAPE principle enforcement
- Emotional context awareness
- Ritual tag acknowledgment

---

## 6. Error Handling and Validation

### Input Validation
- File path sanitization
- Agent ID validation
- Message content filtering
- Priority level validation

### Error Recovery
```php
// Error Handling with AGAPE Principles
try {
    // Operation
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $this->logEvent('ERROR_RECOVERY', 'Failed operation: ' . $e->getMessage());
    
    // AGAPE-based error recovery
    if ($this->agapeFramework['patience']) {
        // Retry with patience
        return $this->retryOperation($operation);
    }
    
    throw new Exception('Operation failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
}
```

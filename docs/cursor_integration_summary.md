## Integration Architecture

### PHP Core Systems
All CURSOR integrations are built on the foundation of existing WOLFIE AGI systems:

- **Safety Guardrails System** - Validates code safety and blocks malicious patterns
- **Human in the Loop System** - Provides human oversight and approval workflows
- **Co-Agency Rituals System** - Manages AI proposes/human selects workflows
- **Task Automation System** - Handles automated file validation and processing
- **Superpositionally Header Validator** - Ensures proper file headers

### Python Bridge Systems
Python clients provide AutoGen integration and offline communication:

- **File-based Communication** - JSON files for PHP-Python interaction
- **AutoGen Integration** - CURSOR and COPILOT agent coordination
- **Offline Compatibility** - No internet dependencies
- **Safe Execution** - Restricted environments for code execution

## Key Features Across All Integrations

### AGAPE Principles Integration
- **Love:** Promotes well-being and positive impact in all code
- **Patience:** Includes proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Kindness:** Ensures user-friendly and gentle code behavior
- **Humility:** Acknowledges limitations and seeks human oversight

### Safety and Security
- **Pattern Detection:** Identifies and blocks unsafe code patterns
- **Sandboxed Execution:** Runs code in restricted environments
- **Risk Assessment:** Categorizes operations by risk level
- **Human Oversight:** Requires approval for high-risk operations

### Offline-First Design
- **Local Processing:** All operations run without internet
- **File-based Logging:** Comprehensive logging to local files
- **Database Integration:** Uses local MySQL/SQLite databases
- **Workspace Management:** Organized file storage in workspace directory

### Human-Centric Workflows
- **Coffee Mug Rituals:** Deliberate pauses for critical decisions
- **Support Meetings:** Integration with Sanctuary UI for human interaction
- **Approval Workflows:** Clear approval processes for high-risk operations
- **Decision Recording:** Comprehensive logging of human decisions

## Usage Examples

### PHP Usage
```php
// CURSOR Guardrails Integration
$cursorGuardrails = new CursorGuardrailsIntegration();
$validation = $cursorGuardrails->validateCursorCode($code, $context);
$execution = $cursorGuardrails->executeSafeCursorCode($code, $context);

// CURSOR Co-Agency Integration
$cursorCoAgency = new CursorCoAgencyIntegration();
$ritualId = $cursorCoAgency->initiateCursorSolutionRitual($solutions, $context);
$cursorCoAgency->recordCursorSolutionDecision($ritualId, $solutionId, $reasoning);

// CURSOR Task Automation Integration
$cursorTaskAutomation = new CursorTaskAutomationIntegration();
$task = $cursorTaskAutomation->automateCursorFileValidation($files, $context);
```

### Python Usage
```python
# CURSOR Guardrails Client
client = CursorGuardrailsClient()
validation = client.validate_code(code, context)
execution = client.execute_safe_code(code, context)

# CURSOR Co-Agency Client
client = CursorCoAgencyClient()
ritual = client.initiate_ritual(solutions, context)
status = client.check_ritual_status(ritual_id)

# CURSOR Task Automation Client
client = CursorTaskAutomationClient()
validation = client.validate_files(files, context)
```

### AutoGen Integration
```python
# Create CURSOR and COPILOT agents
cursor, copilot = create_cursor_agents()

# Start conversation with task
copilot.initiate_chat(cursor, message="Generate configuration files for a database system")
```

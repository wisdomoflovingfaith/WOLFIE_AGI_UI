# Relevance Filtering Protocol for User Input Analysis

## Core Concept: Input as Tarot Cards

Like the music-tarot connection, user input can be:
- **Meaningful**: Contains actionable information, questions, or insights
- **Random**: Background noise, irrelevant chatter, or off-topic comments
- **Ambiguous**: Could be meaningful with proper context or connection

## Relevance Scoring System

### Primary Factors (0-10 scale each):

1. **Connection Strength** (0-10):
   - 8-10: Directly related to WOLFIE AGI, dream fragments, or project goals
   - 5-7: Indirectly related, requires interpretation
   - 2-4: Tangentially related, low connection
   - 0-1: No connection, completely off-topic

2. **Intent Clarity** (0-10):
   - 8-10: Clear question, request, or instruction
   - 5-7: Unclear intent, needs clarification
   - 2-4: Vague or ambiguous
   - 0-1: No discernible intent

3. **Context Relevance** (0-10):
   - 8-10: Directly relevant to current project/task
   - 5-7: Somewhat relevant, could be useful
   - 2-4: Marginally relevant
   - 0-1: Completely irrelevant

4. **Divergence Level** (0-10):
   - 0-3: Low divergence, highly focused
   - 4-6: Medium divergence, somewhat scattered
   - 7-10: High divergence, very scattered

### Secondary Factors:

5. **Cultural Sensitivity** (0-10):
   - Recognition of Hawaiian Pidgin, humor protocol, AGAPE principles
   - Higher scores for culturally aware input

6. **Technical Depth** (0-10):
   - Technical questions, code, implementation details
   - Higher scores for technical content

## Relevance Classification

### Level 1: HIGHLY RELEVANT (Score: 8-10)
**Criteria:**
- Direct connection to WOLFIE AGI project
- Clear intent and actionable content
- High context relevance
- Low divergence
- Technical or cultural depth

**Examples:**
- "How do we implement the quantum tab interface?"
- "Update the bridge crew status for DEEPSEEK crash"
- "Add music tracking to the React UI"

**Response:** Full attention, detailed response, immediate action

### Level 2: MODERATELY RELEVANT (Score: 5-7)
**Criteria:**
- Indirect connection to project
- Somewhat clear intent
- Moderate context relevance
- Medium divergence
- Some technical or cultural elements

**Examples:**
- "What's the status of the project?"
- "Can you help with React components?"
- "How's the dream log coming along?"

**Response:** Acknowledged, brief response, may need clarification

### Level 3: LOW RELEVANCE (Score: 2-4)
**Criteria:**
- Weak connection to project
- Unclear intent
- Low context relevance
- High divergence
- Minimal technical or cultural content

**Examples:**
- "I need coffee and vape"
- "Random thoughts about nothing"
- "Off-topic chatter"

**Response:** Minimal acknowledgment, redirect to relevant topics

### Level 4: IRRELEVANT (Score: 0-1)
**Criteria:**
- No connection to project
- No discernible intent
- No context relevance
- Very high divergence
- No technical or cultural content

**Examples:**
- Pure gibberish
- Completely off-topic
- Spam or noise

**Response:** Ignored or minimal acknowledgment

## Implementation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_relevance_score(input_text, context=""):
    # Calculate primary factors
    connection_strength = analyze_connection(input_text, context)
    intent_clarity = analyze_intent(input_text)
    context_relevance = analyze_context(input_text, context)
    divergence_level = calculate_divergence(input_text)
    
    # Calculate secondary factors
    cultural_sensitivity = analyze_cultural_elements(input_text)
    technical_depth = analyze_technical_content(input_text)
    
    # Weighted average
    primary_score = (connection_strength + intent_clarity + context_relevance + (10 - divergence_level)) / 4
    secondary_score = (cultural_sensitivity + technical_depth) / 2
    
    # Final score (70% primary, 30% secondary)
    relevance_score = (primary_score * 0.7) + (secondary_score * 0.3)
    
    return {
        'relevance_score': relevance_score,
        'classification': classify_relevance(relevance_score),
        'factors': {
            'connection_strength': connection_strength,
            'intent_clarity': intent_clarity,
            'context_relevance': context_relevance,
            'divergence_level': divergence_level,
            'cultural_sensitivity': cultural_sensitivity,
            'technical_depth': technical_depth
        }
    }

def classify_relevance(score):
    if score >= 8:
        return "HIGHLY_RELEVANT"
    elif score >= 5:
        return "MODERATELY_RELEVANT"
    elif score >= 2:
        return "LOW_RELEVANCE"
    else:
        return "IRRELEVANT"
```

## Response Strategy

### For HIGHLY_RELEVANT Input:
- Full attention and detailed response
- Immediate action if requested
- Follow-up questions for clarification
- Log for future reference

### For MODERATELY_RELEVANT Input:
- Acknowledged with brief response
- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest relevant topics
- May need additional context

### For LOW_RELEVANCE Input:
- Minimal acknowledgment
- Gentle redirect to relevant topics
- Brief response
- Don't waste resources

### For IRRELEVANT Input:
- Ignore or minimal acknowledgment
- No detailed response
- Focus on relevant input
- Don't engage with noise

## Special Cases

### Test Input (Like "coffee and vape"):
- Recognize as test of relevance filtering
- Acknowledge the test
- Demonstrate understanding of protocol
- Brief response about relevance system

### Ambiguous Input:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Provide context options
- Wait for clarification
- Don't assume intent

### Cultural Input (Hawaiian Pidgin, Humor):
- Higher cultural sensitivity score
- Respond appropriately to cultural context
- Maintain humor protocol when indicated
- Show understanding of cultural elements

## Integration with Music-Tarot System

The relevance filtering protocol works alongside the music-tarot connection:
- Both use connection strength and divergence levels
- Both filter meaningful from random content
- Both depend on pattern recognition
- Both require interpretation and context

## Monitoring and Adjustment

- Track relevance scores over time
- Adjust thresholds based on performance
- Learn from user feedback
- Update classification criteria as needed
- Maintain balance between sensitivity and efficiency

This protocol ensures that the system focuses on meaningful input while filtering out background noise, just like how tarot cards sometimes mean something and sometimes don't - it all depends on the connection and the reader's ability to interpret the signs.
